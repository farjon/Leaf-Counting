User Manual for Aharon Bar Hillel's team leaf counter

This package contains two option for counting:
    - Counting using a regressor based algorithm
    - Counting using a detection with regression algorithm

For more information read the published paper at:
'https://www.plant-phenotyping.org/lw_resource/datapool/systemfiles/elements/files/63b7a231-949c-11e8-8a88-dead53a91d31/current/document/0031.pdf'

This manual starts by the requirements for training.
Than, we explain how to train each of the counters.
Finally, we explain how to use the prediction script.

0.Requirements:
- Python 3.6.5, GPU (if available, otherwise training will be slow)
- See the requirements.txt file for packages versions
- The Banana leaves dataset (containing annotations of both the number of leaves as well as leaves location).
    To use other datasets, see the Banana leaves dataset to understand the structure.

1. Detection with regression algorithm:
1.1 To train this pipe open LeafCounitng\bin\train_det.py
1.2 Scroll down and find '# Start Editing'
1.3 Change the relevant parameters.
1.4 Choose an experiment number (default is 1)

2. Regression based algorithm:
2.1 To train this pipe open LeafCounitng\bin\train_reg.py
2.2 Scroll down and find '# Start Editing'
2.3 Change the relevant parameters.
2.4 Choose an experiment number (default is 1)

3. Predicting leaf number with a trained model
3.1 To predict the number of leaves open LeafCounting\bin\predict_number_of_leaves.py
3.2 Scroll down and find '# Start Editing'
3.3 Change the relevant parameters and specifically change the path to the trained model
